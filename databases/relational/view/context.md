# Views
 - Views is like a second table generated by a query example:
   - I have a CLIENTS table with NAME and AGE columns
   - I want to make a default select to return only NAME column
   - I can do a view to return only NAME column:
    ``` sql
        create view CLIENTS_NAME as 
        select NOME from cliente;
    ```
