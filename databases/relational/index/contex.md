# Indexes
 - Index in relational databases is like a boook summary
 - When index is created, make the queries more faster, because the SGBD knows with more precision where this data is located
 - Normally, index is created with ```create table``` command
  ```sql 
    CREATE INDEX INDEX_NAME ON TABLE_NAME(COLUMN_NAME)
  ```
